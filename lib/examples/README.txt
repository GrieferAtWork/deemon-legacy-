This folder contains code examples of all kinds of
random stuff I've been coding in deemon over time.

It's just meant for fun and there isn't anything
where you could argue that it doesn't belong in here.

So feel free to send me your own code examples and unless
I'll start getting bombarded with millions of code examples,
you can be sure that you'll be features in here.
